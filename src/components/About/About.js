                The guy who writes like he talks—and talks a lot about movies. Words are my scenes. Ideas are my scripts.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m a Content Writer and Cinephile who believes every sentence should leave an impact—like the last line of a good film. I build narratives, shape tone, and write copy that clicks. Whether it’s a digital brand or a dialogue-heavy indie film, I’m here to tell your story with style (and maybe a post-credit scene).
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond writing, I'm passionate about web development and exploring how technology can enhance storytelling.
